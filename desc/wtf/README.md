# WTF Framework â€” Work-Time-Field Theory

A unified physical model explaining mass, gravity, time, field topology, decay, and cosmology as consequences of localized work in directional fields.

**Core equation:**  
`E = t Â· g`  
(Energy is the result of temporal and spatial work in the field)

## ðŸ”¬ What it explains:
- Why mass exists and vanishes;
- Why isotopes are stable only in narrow corridors;
- Why tunneling occurs without imaginary energy;
- Why the universe "expands" (or rather: collapses);
- Why digital systems degrade differently under energy flux;
- How field geometry could enable healing, propulsion, even time modulation.

## ðŸ§ª Includes:
- Full LaTeX source (for arXiv);
- Simulations (Python);
- MIT license for open scientific use.

\> No citations. No borrowed axioms.  
\> Just physics, as it actually behaves.
