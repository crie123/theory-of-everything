\section{Code Listings and Simulation Scripts}

All experiments were simulated using Python (NumPy, Matplotlib) and are reproducible on any local environment. Each script outputs the respective image used in this paper.

\subsection{1. Memory Degradation Under Work-Field}

\textbf{Script:} \texttt{experiments/degradation\_simulation.py}  
\textbf{Output:} \texttt{figures/Figure\_1.png}

Simulates aging of a digital memory device under increasing localized energy (field work), comparing linear baseline vs. accelerated decay.

\subsection{2. Instantaneous Collapse}

\textbf{Script:} \texttt{experiments/instant\_decay\_model.py}  
\textbf{Output:} \texttt{figures/Figure\_2.png}

Shows what happens when field tension passes the critical threshold â€” complete collapse of state within a single timestep.

\subsection{3. Quantum Tunneling Visualization}

\textbf{Script:} \texttt{experiments/tunneling\_4nm.py}  
\textbf{Output:} \texttt{figures/tunneling\_vs\_width\_4nm.png}

Tunneling is plotted as a function of barrier width. WTF curve is overlaid against standard QM. 4\,nm appears as critical phase point.

\subsection{4. Gravitational Map Simulation}

\textbf{Script:} \texttt{experiments/gravi\_field\_mapping.py}  
\textbf{Output:} \texttt{figures/gravi\_map\_final.png}

A 2D grid of field coherence is plotted to identify distortions, useful for navigation, gravitational zones, and safe jumping corridors.
