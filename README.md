# theory of everything

This project presents a comprehensive, dual-language theoretical and computational framework to model mass, field dynamics, spacetime distortion, and energy transfer using structured graviton work. It includes:

- A complete interactive simulator in Streamlit (`main_app.py`)
- Full LaTeX documentation in English and Russian (`engru=theory.pdf`)
- Real-time plotting of wave-like degradation, isotopic stability, radar maps, and more
- Experimental concepts for physical validation: neutrino-H2 glow, field degradation, jump field mechanics

##  Requirements

```bash
pip install streamlit matplotlib numpy
```

## ▶️ Launch the Simulator

```bash
streamlit run main_app.py
```

## Documentation

See `уравнения.pdf`, `теория.pdf` for the theoretical foundation, including all derived equations and experimental models. Bilingual (English and Russian).
